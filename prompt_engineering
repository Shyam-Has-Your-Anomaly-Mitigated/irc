someone (who is bad at english) in my ashram asked me to teach them programming; for artificial intelligence
i said prompt engineering is the future; regardlless of programming, or artificial intelligence
roadmap: touch typing (mudra), english english (vyakarana, nirukta), linguistics(vedanga), (meta)prompt enginerring (verbosity, in every dimension; just as in hacking, we get bugs, single shot prompting is mythical, for the feedback loop(s)),..
day1(12024.09.22): <95%(14wpm), me 100%(75wpm; wow, i can do the work of over 5 people!)

think raku calls it a prompt (raku from perl from /sh|linux|bsd/), but prolog is more like the og chatgpt; you train its' kbs, and prompt engineer its' queries
