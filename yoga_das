das yoga, o(de)r die yoga; just as perl supports unicode, the next support is multilingual
ß = ḍi in devanāgarī - shirorekha(the name of my \n, where \n=1\n, shortcut language; i have to check my notes for what the longcut is…)

it's great to have a mental perspective, just like trevor noah didn't mention mahabharata; we called ourselves great #first!
shirorekha doesn't support a standard \b; it uses the time dimension to maintain unmaintainable \n, and actually the \n is an illusion, because there is no \n in shirorekha (todo: watch https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKhFHcfe2KU, and find some"-thing" along the lines of "there is no game", and friends)
 at first i thought there was no \b, but i remember ttime as the metahack
