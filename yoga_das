ß = ḍi in devanāgarī - shirorekha(the name of my \n, where \n=1\n, shortcut language; i have to check my notes for what the longcut is…)
http://www.sanskritweb.net/deutsch/devanagari.pdf
it's great to have a mental perspective, just like trevor noah didn't mention mahabharata; we called ourselves great #first!
shirorekha doesn't support a standard \b; it uses the time dimension to maintain unmaintainable \n, and actually the \n is an illusion, because there is no \n in shirorekha (todo: watch https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKhFHcfe2KU, and find some"-thing" along the lines of "there is no game", and friends)
 at first i thought there was no \b, but i remember ttime as the metahack; /^\b/ is like going left first in a videogame, we call it engaging the \back to the future mode(or whatever, i can't remember all the concepts; it's not only a modal concept #set-theory)
the length of \n has a dependency based on the memory of the hacker; just to be very clear, the \n must be "visual" in a dimensional singularity, but that is only a fraction of the mindset required to fully contain indian epic poetry, bringing /(..|new|..|old|..)?/ meaning to intellectual capacity
 going outside the lines is when you temporarily exceed "visual" tolerance; the /^/, and /$/, must (commitreasure)remain "visual" (this is the equivalent of panini changing the language early in ashtadhyayi, and then changing it back by the end of it all the while maintaining the iching with the consistency of well over a thousand mosquito bites)

  what do boundary programs do? /^|$/, they both start, and stop? they can just be memory /hacks|cracks/?
everyone says to hold the problem in your head
everyone says to hold the program in your head
shirorekha is meditation, followed by interpretive dance
every (hello world) program has more intelligence lurking behind it; all it takes is a /god|particle|../
the first lesson of shirorekha is to think like a mathematician; how many is in your head, and how does that equate with the size of the file
zero-width operating systems, editors, prompts,..
