Re: WTFâ€½

ðŸ–– Hello World,

IDK how I found this emailâ€½ One'd think you'd be leading in the practice of leveraging the agentic agenda to solve your technical support problem, and make your address more readily accessibleâ€¦ (Still afraid of jailbreaking? It's been a while since I wanted to know how to make nukes, and whatnot; it's so last model!)

I deleted all my cache, and cookies, and rebooted; but chatgpt.com is still just a prompt that exclusively supports the typing feature, and without the upload feature.

Network inspection; nevermind, now the prompt disappeared, and the only remaining features supported are the background colour, and the question mark button that does no"-thing" in the bottom left corner (try moving it to a different corner; that one seems cursed, and I fear iff it goes; it will only accelerate the decay rate of the cosmic microwave background radiation, and that spells doom for us all). So crazy it coincidentally occuerrd during email composition, I will stop here; although, I have contemplated industrial espionage, the alternative is o1 told you it was a good idea for a publicity stunt.

LIVE LONG AND PROSPER \V/,
AGENT S.

PS:
I got openai.com to sai "Application error: a client-side exception has occurred (see the browser console for more information)." in the middle of the page; what a thought provoking CSS feature.
I got chatgpt.com to sai "404 page not found" as a plain text file.
Now they stopped doing that, but I think I know how to replicate the openai.com one.
I like you're response to my email; since they don't include what they're responding to, I won't reply to yours, and just reply to mine.

Your second email @ 23 Sep 2024 12:39:12 +1000 sai "Rate your conversation", with 5 emos; this secondary redundancy couldn't been appended to the primary redundancy.

PSS: It's working now; thanks!
