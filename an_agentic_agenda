Re: WTFâ€½

ðŸ–– Hello World,

IDK how I found this emailâ€½ One'd think you'd be leading in the practice of leveraging the agentic agenda to solve your technical support problem, and make your address more readily accessibleâ€¦ (Still afraid of jailbreaking? It's been a while since I wanted to know how to make nukes, and whatnot; it's so last model!)

I deleted all my cache, and cookies, and rebooted; but chatgpt.com is still just a prompt that exclusively supports the typing feature, and without the upload feature.

Network inspection; nevermind, now the prompt disappeared, and the only remaining features supported are the background colour, and the question mark button that does no"-thing" in the bottom left corner (try moving it to a different corner; that one seems cursed, and I fear iff it goes; it will only accelerate the decay rate of the cosmic microwave background radiation, and that spells doom for us all). So crazy it coincidentally occuerrd during email composition, I will stop here; although, I have contemplated industrial espionage, the alternative is o1 told you it was a good idea for a publicity stunt.

LIVE LONG AND PROSPER \V/,
AGENT S.
